# Supervised-Learning-Linear-Regression

Examples using Supervised Learning in Linear Regression

The work done in this repository is from the book "Python: Machine Learning" by Wei-Meng Lee. I do not own the legal rights to it.

I learned abt the various types of linear regression.  In particular, I learned about the llowing:

Multiple Regression - Linear relationships between two or more independent variables and one depenent variable.

Polynomial Regression - Modelig the relationship beween one independent variable and one dependent variabl using an nth degree polynomial polynomial function.

Polynomial Multiple Regression - modeling the relationship between two or more independent variables and one dependent variable using an nth degree polynomial function.

I also learned how to plot the hyperplane showing the relationships between two independent variables and the label.
